# Monopoly-Clone

Hey there! Thanks for viewing my Monopoly-Clone!

To run the clone, simply clone the repo & launch the main.java to your terminal.

You can either do so directly from the terminal, or in your favorite IDE!

Note: Some functionality is omitted in the current version of the clone. Non-property spaces are currently non-interactable, and will function as "Free Parking" spaces.
